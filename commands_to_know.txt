sort - Sorts standard input then outputs the sorted result on standard output.
uniq - Given a sorted stream of data from standard input, it removes duplicate lines of data (i.e., it makes sure that every line is unique).
grep - Examines each line of data it receives from standard input and outputs every line that contains a specified pattern of characters.
fmt - Reads text from standard input, then outputs formatted text on standard output.
pr - Takes text input from standard input and splits the data into pages with page breaks, headers and footers in preparation for printing.
head - Outputs the first few lines of its input. Useful for getting the header of a file.
tail - Outputs the last few lines of its input. Useful for things like getting the most recent entries from a log file.
tr - Translates characters. Can be used to perform tasks such as upper/lowercase conversions or changing line termination characters from one type to another (for example, converting DOS text files into Unix style text files).
sed - Stream editor. Can perform more sophisticated text translations than tr.
awk - An entire programming language designed for constructing filters. Extremely powerful.
