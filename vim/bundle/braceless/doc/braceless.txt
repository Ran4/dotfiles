INTRODUCTION                                                  *braceless-intro*
==============================================================================

Braceless adds |text-objects| for languages that use the off-side rule
(indentation) to define blocks of code.

Python is the primary focus of this plugin, but there is some support for
Coffee Script.  Without configuration, this plugin will be more or less like
the vim-indent-object plugin in other file types.

See |braceless-taxonomy| for information on what is considered a block.


RATIONALE                                                 *braceless-rationale*
==============================================================================

Sometimes, I want to simply select/delete/replace entire blocks of Python
code.  Using plugins that turn indentation into text objects fall short when
encountering multi-line bits with varying indent levels, or docstrings that
legally break the indentation.

I started writing this plugin to deal with just that.  When the plugin started
taking shape, it turned out that I could also add useful folding, and somewhat
smarter auto-indent.  Also highlighting the block the cursor is on.  Oh, and
why not throw in some EasyMotion support, too?  So, I slapped cool ASCII text
art at the top of this thing and now you're sitting here reading about it.


QUICK START                                              *braceless-quickstart*
==============================================================================
*BracelessEnable*

By default, this plugin will do nothing.  This is because it will override key
maps set by the built-in Python ftplugin.  There is also the fact that almost
every plugin for Python has its own opinion about what |[[| and |]]| means,
this one not excluded.  The goal is to not break your existing workflow if you
have such a Python plugin installed.  In addition to that, this plugin will
work with other languages and it's up to you to enable it if you want to use
it in something other than Python.

If you want to just get started, add a line like this to your |vimrc| file:
>
  autocmd FileType python,coffee BracelessEnable +indent
<
EasyMotion support is enabled by default and allows you to move around by
braceless text objects.  If you want this feature to be disabled, add the
following to your |vimrc| file:
>
  let g:braceless_enable_easymotion = 0
<

TEXT OBJECT TAXONOMY                                       *braceless-taxonomy*
==============================================================================

Python Example
>
   1. def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
   2.     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n.
   3.
   4. Some extra text to ruin the indent.
   5. """
   6.     a, b = 0, 1
   7.     while a < n:
   8.         print(a, end=' ')
   9.         a, b = b, a+b
  10.     print()
  11.
  12.
  13. if spam \
  14.      and eggs:
  15.   print('ham')
  16.   more_spam()

<
- Lines 1, 7, and 13 are block heads
- Lines 1, 7, and 14 are block tails
- Lines 2-10, 8-9, and 15-16 are block bodies

The block head defines where the indentation starts.  The block tail defines
where the body begins.  The body spans from the block tail, up to another
block that is at the same or lower indent level as the block head.  When
finding the end of the body, blank lines, strings, comments, and heredoc lines
are ignored.


Braceless works with other languages by only considering indent level.  Take
HAML for example:
>
  1. #content
  2.   .left.column
  3.     %h2 Welcome to our site!
  4.     %p= print_information
  5.   .right.column
  6.     = render :partial => "sidebar"
<
Every line is considered a potential block.  When it comes to selecting
blocks, if a block appears to have no body, selection will use a lower indent
level instead.  That means that if you are on line 4 and press `vaP`, lines
2-4 will be selected.

While the primary focus of this plugin is for Python, it could be useful for
other languages that rely heavily on indentation.


CONFIGURATION                                                *braceless-config*
==============================================================================

All mappings displayed below are the default values.  You don't need to add
them to your |vimrc| unless you want to change them.  If you want to disable a
mapping, assign it an empty string.


*g:braceless_block_key*

This sets the text object key.  This gives you commands like `vaP`, `ciP`,
`diP`, etc.

Default:
>
  let g:braceless_block_key = 'P'
<

*g:braceless_jump_prev_key*
*g:braceless_jump_next_key*

By default, these let you move around using the |[[| and |]]| keys.  The following
sequences are also mapped with these keys:

  *g]*    Move forward to an increased indent level
  *g[*    Move backward to a decreased indent level

Default:
>
  let g:braceless_jump_prev_key = '['
  let g:braceless_jump_next_key = ']'
<

*g:braceless_easymotion_prev_key*
*g:braceless_easymotion_next_key*

Keys used with EasyMotion.  By default, uses |g:braceless_jump_prev_key| and
|g:braceless_jump_next_key|.  See: |braceless-easymotion|

Default:
>
  let g:braceless_easymotion_prev_key = g:braceless_jump_prev_key
  let g:braceless_easymotion_next_key = g:braceless_jump_next_key
<

INDENTATION                                                  *braceless-indent*
==============================================================================
*+indent*

Using |+indent| in the |BracelessEnable| command will enable this plugin's
|indentexpr|.

There is not much to say about the general indentation Braceless performs.  It
tries to be smart about how it suggests indentation based on blocks.  It also
adds PEP 8 indentation for collection symbols (|(| |)|, |[| |]|, |{| |}|).  If
you create two blank lines, indentation will drop one level.

When performing auto-indent with |=|, docstrings will be aligned to where the
string starts.  I'm still deciding whether or not they should be left alone.

Braceless takes some syntactic clues into account when performing auto
indentation in Python, but without clearly defined boundaries for blocks, it's
difficult to do accurately.  With that said, it does work fairly well.

tl;dr:  auto-indent will not go out of its way to fix your syntactically
incorrect indentation.

See |braceless-custom-indent| for info on how to write your own indent rules.


FOLDING                                                       *braceless-folds*
==============================================================================
*+fold* *+fold-inner*

⚠️  This can slow down the loading of large scripts!

As with indentation, folding is based on blocks.
>
  1. if spam \
  2.      and eggs:
  3.   print('ham')
  4.   more_spam()
<
Using |+fold| in the |BracelessEnable| command, the fold will be on line 1.
If you use |+fold-inner|, the fold will be on line 3 (the cursor must be
somewhere between lines 3 and 4).  The choice as to which is the best is up to
you.


HIGHLIGHT                                                 *braceless-highlight*
==============================================================================
*+highlight* *+highilght-cc* *+highlight-cc2* *BracelessIndent*

Highlighting can be used to show you what Braceless considers to be the
operative block.
>
  1. if spam \
  2.      and eggs:
  3.   print('ham')
  4.   more_spam()
<
Using |+highlight| in the |BracelessEnable| command, a solid line will appear
under the "i" on line 1.

If you use |+highlight-cc| the |colorcolumn| will be used instead.  This will
visually show the indent level, but for the entire height of the window.

If you use |+highlight-cc2| the |colorcolumn| and standard highlighting will
be enabled.  This is useful if you have a giant wall of code.

The group name of the highlight column is |BracelessIndent| and is defaulted
to:
>
  highlight BracelessIndent ctermfg=3 ctermbg=0 cterm=inverse
<
This uses an inverse style with a foreground color.  This is the only way for
|+highlight-cc2| to work as described.  Otherwise, the |ColorColumn| style
will override the background color.


EASYMOTION                                               *braceless-easymotion*
==============================================================================

Braceless adds a few simple searches to EasyMotion.  While EasyMotion is
invoked (default: <leader><leader>), |[| will search for blocks before the
cursor, |]| will search for blocks after the cursor, and |P| will search for
blocks in both directions.

EasyMotion is a plugin worthy of the highest praise.  Do yourself a favor and
install it if you haven't already.


OTHER LANGUAGES                                              *braceless-custom*
==============================================================================

If it's a language that uses indentation to define blocks, Braceless should be
able to do for them what it does for Python.  Python support is not hard
coded in the core functions, so you should be able to use to use them as
needed to support your language of choice.  In fact, Python support is
auxiliary.  Take a look at `autoload/braceless/python.vim` to
see how it works.

There are a couple |autocmd|s and functions that can help get your
customizations setup when Braceless is enabled.

*BracelessInit*                   Called when Braceless is enabled for the
                                first time, giving you a chance to define
                                patterns, or anything else that requires
                                Braceless to be present.
>
  function! s:my_init()
    " Only allow jumping to `if` statements.
    let g:braceless#pattern#python = {'jump': '\%(if\)\_.\{-}:'}
  endfunction

  autocmd User BracelessInit call s:my_init()

<
*BracelessEnabled_<filetype>*     Called when Braceless is enabled in a
                                buffer.  This is where you would setup custom
                                indent, folding, key maps, and so on.
>
  function! s:my_enabled()
    ...
  endfunction

  autocmd User BracelessEnabled_haml call s:my_enabled()
<

CUSTOM INDENT                                         *braceless-indent-custom*
==============================================================================

You can customize how |indentexpr| behaves through
`braceless#indent#add_handler()`, which expects a dict of functions, with any
of the following keys: `collection`, `docstring`, and `block`.

|collection| is a handler for the content of symbols that collect values, like
`()`, `[]`, `{}`.  It is passed a line number, a list of the beginning [line,
col], and a list of the ending [line, col]

|docstring| is a handler for doctrings/heredoc content.  It is passed a line
number, and list of the [start, end] lines.

|block| is a handler for braceless blocks.  It is passed a line number, and a
list of [block start, block end, block head line, block tail line].

If any of these functions want to defer to Braceless's indent handling, they
should throw 'cont'.

There are a couple utilities that will be useful for indentation:

`braceless#indent#level(line,delta)` - Given a line, it will return its indent
level with an adjusted delta.

`braceless#indent#space(line,delta)` - Given a line, it will return a list of
[character, length] with the length having an adjusted delta.

Look at `autoload/braceless/indent.vim` and `autoload/braceless/python.vim`
for examples.


CUSTOM PATTERNS                                            *braceless-patterns*
==============================================================================

Braceless can be customized to match blocks in different languages.  Keep in
mind that this plugin is designed to deal with indented blocks.

A pattern can be defined using:
>
  let g:braceless#pattern#<filetype> = {
  \   'start': '',
  \   'stop': '',
  \   'jump': '',
  \   'easymotion': '',
  \ }
<
The keys mentioned above defines a regexp |pattern|.  The most important being
`start` which is used as the default for `jump` and `easymotion` if they are
missing.  The `stop` pattern helps Braceless understand where the block ends,
but shouldn't be necessary to define in most situations.  When omitted,
`start` will default to `\S.*`, and `stop` will default to `\S`.

The patterns should only include the text that you actually want to match.
Braceless prefixes the patterns with an extra bit that helps it match
indentation.  You may add |\zs| and |\ze| to define where the cursor should
land.  If your pattern omits these, Braceless will add them to the beginning
and end of your patterns as needed.

For example, here is the default `start` pattern (shortened for the example)
for Python:
>
 \%(if\|def\|for\|elif\|else\|with\|class\|while\)\_.\{-}:
<
This pattern searches for the text in the first atom followed by any character
(including newlines, as few as possible), followed by a colon.  When selecting
a block at indent level 1, the pattern is transformed into:
>
 ^ \{-,4}\zs\%(if\|def\|for\|elif\|else\|with\|class\|while\)\_.\{-}:
<
Look at `autoload/braceless.vim` for a more complicated example for
CoffeeScript.

If you want to override a default pattern, you only need to define the key you
wish to override.  For example, suppose you want |[[| and |]]| to only move
to `class` and `def` blocks, while retaining the ability to select other
blocks:
>
  let g:braceless#pattern#python = {
  \   'jump': '\%(def\|class\)\_.\{-}:',
  \ }
<
